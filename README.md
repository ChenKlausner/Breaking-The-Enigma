# Breaking-The-Enigma
This Java project encompasses an Enigma machine implementation, complete with an automatic decipher process. The machine implementation is dynamically configured based on an XML file, offering a versatile and generic solution adaptable to various scales. The development process delves into advanced Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) concepts and principles, leveraging features such as interfaces, encapsulation, and adherence to SOLID principles.

The architecture of the project is robust, incorporating support for multiple threads, file operations, collections, and other fundamental OOP concepts. It spans across different user interfaces, including a console interface, a desktop application, and a client-server model based on HTTP. This diverse architecture not only showcases the flexibility of the Enigma machine implementation but also highlights the project's proficiency in handling various application scenarios.
